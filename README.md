# Ferrite Segmentation

Notes: 
Decided to train 2 classes: primary and proeutectoid ferrite with the training set consisting of 20 images total: 
  10 primary ferrite images are 5 from 2 Al composition and 5 from 1 Si 2 Al composition. 
  10 proeutectoid ferrite images are 5 from 2 Si composition and 5 from 3 Si comsposition.
